It started with a simple notification tucked away in my inbox: `“Payment failed.”`

At first, I brushed it off. Maybe it was a glitch, maybe my card just needed to be retried. I told myself I'd deal with it later.

But later came quickly. The next time I opened my laptop, ready to dive into a project I'd been pouring myself into, I was met with a wall: `“Your subscription could be suspended.”` Suddenly, the tools I depended on weren’t just tools anymore—they were locked behind a barrier I couldn’t cross.

The frustration was sharp. How could something as small as a missed payment stop everything? But beneath the frustration was something heavier—embarrassment. I didn’t want to admit that I couldn’t keep up with something so basic.

As the days ticked by, the pressure grew. Every reminder email felt louder, every deadline closer. My ideas sat waiting, but I couldn’t reach them. It wasn’t just about money—it was about momentum, about the rhythm of creating and the pain of being forced to pause.

And that pause carried weight. It wasn’t just about losing access to an app—it was about losing momentum, losing the sense of progress I had built. It felt like being locked out of a part of myself.
